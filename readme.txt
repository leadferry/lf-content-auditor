== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Why don't you have Twitter/Google Plus share count?**

Our plugin relies on share count data made available to developers by the social platforms.

Twitter recently disabled providing share count. Google Plus does not have any official method to get sharing numbers. Since we do not have access to the share data of these platforms, we are unable to incorporate it into our reports.

**What output formats do you support?**

Currently, we support report generation in CSV format compatible with Microsoft Excel, Open Office and other office suites.

**Why does it say it may take a long time if we select Meta Title/Meta Description?**

Meta title and meta description are often handled by third party plugins. There is no native way to pull the information from these plugins. Hence, we have to relay on a custom mechanism that takes time to ensure the data is capture and presented in your report without errors. Unchecking these metrics will result in quicker report generation.

2. More options for you. Select the social sharing metrics that matters to you. Select whether to add posts or pages or both in your audit report. To ensure quick report generation and avoid report duplication, you can audit content based on their created time.
